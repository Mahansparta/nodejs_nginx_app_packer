## ERB and ice cream cones <% %> and <%= %>

ERB is embed ruby.

Meaning you can interpolate variable or run ruby code.

It can then be converted to a string.

ERB is like the f'this is python {hello} ' but for entire documents!

####  <% %>  allow ruby with no output

####  <%= %> allows ruby with output (I mean like printing to the documents)
